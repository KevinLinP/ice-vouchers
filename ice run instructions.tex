(things don't go smoothly, just improvise as necessary)

\hspace{1cm}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Either Wangover or one of the shift members will have the cash pouch, which holds the cash needed to buy the ice.
  \item Arrive on shift around 1:00pm, and find the megaphone and wagons. Call 'Ice Run' on the megaphone, and give the camp 5 minutes to get the last orders in.
  \item Grab the clipboard and wagons, and get in line at the 9 o'clock Arctica. While in line, count up the the bags of crushed and block ice needed. Get the needed cash ready.
  \item Get back to camp, announce that you guys are back on the megaphone, and deliver the ice to the coolers for any \emph{absent/occupied} camp members. Paperclip the fulfilled ice vouchers and order forms and put them in the cash change pouch.
  \item Designate someone to hand off the cash pouch to someone on the next shift.
\end{enumerate}
